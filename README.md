# uHand inspired and powered by uMyo

uHand is a full hand manipulator and wrist but not a forearm. uhand requires the user to adapt the WristBracket.SLDPRT file to fit the forearm design they are using. This is as individuals have different amputations and forearm shapes making it not possible to design a one size fits all mount that would work well with this many degrees of freedom. uHand was not made by UltimateRobotics, but was designed to work with their incredible uMyo EMG sensor. uHand requires seven driver motors.
